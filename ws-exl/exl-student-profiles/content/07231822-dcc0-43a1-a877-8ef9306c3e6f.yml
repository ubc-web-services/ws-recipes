She said: </span><em><span lang="EN-US">“You have led an interesting life. I want you to write a story for me”.</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> I wrote four short stories for her that Christmas, another four for her birthday and another four stories this past Christmas. I enjoyed the process but had to admit that I didn’t really know what I was doing. I started searching for a course to take and landed on </span><a href="https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/courses/writing-well-storytelling/0300"><span lang="EN-US">Writing Well: Storytelling</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> at UBC, my alma mater. It looked like just the thing so I signed up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>What was a highlight for you from the course?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">My birth certificate says I am a senior citizen. Like anyone of my vintage, I am keen to remain sharp mentally. This course proved to be a great way to do that while learning something new and having fun doing it. In a note I posted thanking the instructor for the course, I said it was like he had taken one of those Swiffer mops and cleaned some cobwebs out of my 70-year-old brain. A necessary exercise!</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>What surprised you about the course?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">I am a long-time rugby referee. You don’t last long without a thick hide. It was a surprise to me how shy I was initially about writing something and putting it “out there” for the instructor and other students to read, comment on and, possibly, criticize. Fortunately, I got over the shyness quickly thanks to the encouragement of my instructor (which was not surprising) but also my fellow students (which was surprising). I was pleasantly surprised that my fellow students took the time to make thoughtful and encouraging comments on the pieces I submitted. I tried to do likewise.</span></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>How are you applying the skills you learned in your personal or professional life?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Personally, the course has already helped me develop a more critical eye. The proof lies in the re-writes and edits I have done on pieces I wrote before I took </span><a href="https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/courses/writing-well-storytelling/0300"><span lang="EN-US">Writing Well: Storytelling</span></a><span lang="EN-US">. The newly rewritten pieces are, on average, 1/3 shorter than the originals and are the better for it.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Who would you recommend this course to?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">The not-too-helpful answer is that I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to write better.&nbsp; I wanted to get better at writing non-fiction, but the course was just as valuable for fiction writers. &nbsp;Because I am in the demographic, I recommend the course especially to seniors. You are never too old to go back to school. The course was a great workout for the brain. Change is good, especially when it pushes you outside your comfort zone.&nbsp;</span></p>'
