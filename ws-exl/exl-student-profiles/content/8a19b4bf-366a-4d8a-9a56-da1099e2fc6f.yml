Here''s what these online courses have meant for him.</em></p><p><strong>How would you describe your Academic Explorations experiences?</strong><br>My experience has been excellent. I liked the fact that it was a multi-week program so that I could learn things over a longer period of time. I especially liked that the classes were recorded since I wasn''t always able to watch them live due to other commitments. I could go back to view the recordings at my leisure, which I appreciated.</p><p>The professors for the courses I took were all generally very engaging and I would certainly take another class from them again if it was offered.</p><p><strong>What was it like learning online?</strong><br>The online Zoom environment was new for everyone in the last year, but I think that most people (both students and instructors) were able to do a good job navigating this change and make the courses fun.</p><p>The UBC staff members present during the classes really did a good job of managing student expectations, but also did everything they could to explain how to get the most out of the course and the online environment, and I think this was key to making the courses run as smoothly as they did.</p><p><strong>What was your favourite part of attending the UBC Academic Explorations courses?</strong><br>I appreciated the diverse content and was able to find a lot of different interesting subjects to learn about. I liked that the instructors were so engaging and that they took time to answer student questions.</p><p>I also liked that some of the courses included up-to-the-minute topics on COVID-19 from experts in various fields, such as in Perspectives on Canadian and World News. I consistently learned new and very interesting things each time I attended a class.</p><p><strong>Did you have a favourite course or instructor?</strong><br>I tend to most enjoy the history, science, human civilization and politics courses. Some of my favourite courses included:</p><ul><li><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Six Great Cities of the Pre-Modern World</em></li><li><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Workshops of Geniuses - From the Renaissance to the 21st Century</em></li><li><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Food in Human Culture</em></li><li><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Continuity and Change in Global Politics</em></li><li><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Perspectives on Canadian and World News</em></li></ul><p><a href="/node/385212" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="64755114-7a35-4b54-8e5d-bb84cd290cc4" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><span>Read more student profiles.</span></a></p>'
