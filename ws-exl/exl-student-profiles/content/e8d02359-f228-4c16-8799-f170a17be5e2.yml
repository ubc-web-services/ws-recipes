Being an immigrant can feel very isolating sometimes, and </span><a><span>the course was a great opportunity to meet people and learn together as a community.</span></a><span> My classmates were from all over the world, including Quebec! We had the chance to learn about each other’s cultures and to network with other international professionals. I’ve stayed in touch with a group from my class, and we still meet up and get together.</span></p><p><span><strong>What surprised you about the course?</strong></span></p><p>I was surprised that we covered so much theory and practice in just two months. Having done grad studies, I could see that this course is a good mix of theory and research-based content, taught in a practical way. We were provided with excellent resources like TED Talks and research papers to continue learning outside of class, which is great because public speaking is a lifelong pursuit.</p><p><span><strong>How are you applying the skills you learned in your professional life?</strong></span></p><p><span>The course has had a great impact not just on my English skills, but also on how I do presentations in my first language. I feel more confident attending and presenting at conferences and at work. The course has also helped me pitch my ideas more effectively to team leaders and other stakeholders. I wish to be a keynote speaker in the future, and this course helped support me in working toward my goal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Who would you recommend&nbsp;</strong></span><a href="https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/courses/public-speaking-international-professionals/0290"><span>Public Speaking for International Professionals</span></a><span><strong> to?</strong></span></p><p><span>I think this course could benefit people in all sorts of roles in business or social work.
