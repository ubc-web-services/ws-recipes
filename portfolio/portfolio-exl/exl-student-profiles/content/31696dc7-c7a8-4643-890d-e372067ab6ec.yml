A graphic novelist and professional illustrator, he wanted to study science, and use his skills to support and advocate for neurodiverse, 2SLGBTQIA+ and transgender communities.</p><p>But he was completing the program at the end of 2021, Milo had so many opportunities in front of him, he had to turn a few down, including a book deal. “The opportunities have been unbelievable. The door just opened up for me,” he says.</p><p>It was the opportunity to pursue research that proved the most irresistible. In 2022, Milo will begin a Master of Science (Epidemiology) at SFU, where he’ll study health determinants of autism in Two-Spirit communities.</p><p>“One of the reasons I became interested in science communications is I see people from underprivileged socioeconomic positions unable to get their illnesses diagnosed because of a vocabulary barrier,” says Milo.</p><p>“I could have had a career in illustration and it would be have been comfortable and fun,” he adds. “The BMVC program has opened doors to advocacy and methods I can use to help other people. And It has empowered me to talk to those who are educated in science and research.”</p><p>Milo has also been invited to join the Two-Spirit Dry Lab, Turtle Island’s (Canada’s) first research group that focuses on the wellbeing of Two-Spirit and Indigenous people.</p><p>“It’s everything I could have dreamed of.
