The videos are well-presented and professional. I also enjoyed the course structure and self-paced style. You can complete the modules mostly at your own pace, with the exception of the middle course and final project assignments.</span></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>What surprised you about the program?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">The first course, Intro to Systematic Program Design in Python Part I, is beginner-friendly. In Part II, I was pleasantly surprised by the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained from both courses to create well-designed and systematic programs. The course provides excellent guidance on functions and program design.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">I have done a lot of online courses, but the practice and systematic approach on how to design programs and functions in Python are highly valuable. This is something free online tutorials can''t teach.</span></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>How can the knowledge and skills gained from the program be applied in either a professional or personal setting?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">The knowledge and skills gained in this program can be used to build structured programs that businesses need or to create personal programs. A range of structured programs could be created to help in automation tasks, for example reading and displaying statistics, charts and information from a file by simply typing in the name of the file into the program.</span></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Who would you recommend this program to?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">I would recommend this program to anyone who would like to know what a software development course is like, to those who want to upskill their knowledge in Python and learn how to design programs in a structured way, and to anyone who is unsure if coding is something they enjoy but would like to try it out before enrolling to a degree in computer science.</span></p><p><a href="/node/385217" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="717f01cf-7861-48a9-b051-e4945415e9ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><span>Read more student profiles.</span></a></p>'
