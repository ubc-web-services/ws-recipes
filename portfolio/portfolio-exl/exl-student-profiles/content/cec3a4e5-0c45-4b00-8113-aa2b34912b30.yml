I needed a robust, varied and well-kitted communication toolbox for our conversations to be effective and have meaningful outcomes. I have found coaching to be an extremely helpful tool in navigating different conversations and harnessing the potential of my team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"><strong>Why did you choose an organizational coaching credential?</strong></span><span lang="EN-CA"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA">I love that organizational coaching approaches coaching from a holistic and systemic point of view. As an organizational coach, your focus is on how systems work individually and collectively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"><strong>Was the time, effort and money worth it?</strong></span><span lang="EN-CA"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA">It was worth it. Not only did I gain the skills I was looking for, but I also connected with a wider community of coaches. This was key to my understanding of being part of a whole, and working in a system. UBC has also provided opportunities for alumni coaches to participate in events and apply their coaching skills.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"><strong>What surprised you about the program?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA">UBC’s commitment to the continuous support and development of alumni coaches is both good and unexpected.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"><strong>How do you apply your skills in your role and life?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA">I actively use coaching in my role and have also offered coaching sessions to colleagues. I’m partnering with a colleague to deliver a coaching workshop for leaders on my team. I also offer pro bono coaching.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"><strong>How have things changed in your life and career since taking this program?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA">The program has improved the quality of conversations I have. I am a better listener and more self-aware, and I make fewer assumptions. At work, I have a richer toolkit to navigate challenging conversations and to ask questions for clarity.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"><strong>Can you describe a recent coaching engagement?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA">I coached an acquaintance who lost her job during the pandemic. She was going through stressful times. Our long-term coaching engagement helped her gain self-awareness about limiting thoughts and behaviours that were impeding her progress. She found the intervention helpful.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"><strong>What is your advice for someone considering this program?</strong></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA">The coaching program was intense. I had to deal with the huge difference in time zones, plus I work full-time. I was also taking another certificate course at the same time. Determination, time management and planning were key.</span></p><p><a href="/node/385214" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="516806a9-f6e6-441f-9eef-849bfae7efc8" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><span>Read more student profiles.</span></a><span lang="EN-CA"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-CA"></span></p>'
